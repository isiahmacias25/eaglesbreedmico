      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2022, the Eagles Breed Brotherhood MC has grown from a small group of passionate riders into a respected organization. 
        The Miami County Chapter was established in 2024 to unite riders in the area, creating a space for fellowship and giving back to the community. 
        Over the years, we’ve organized countless charity rides, supported local causes, and built a legacy of loyalty and service.
